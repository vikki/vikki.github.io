Hey! I'm Vikki, and this is my blog. It'll mostly be about javascript, webgl, and other related web-nerdery, as that'll prevent me from boring my long suffering co-workers too much, but I also <3 bikram yoga, music, kawfee and a bunch of other things, on which I may choose to rant :)

Anyway, if you have any questions/comments/heckling on any of this stuff (or even if you don't!) please [say hello](https://twitter.com/vikkiread)
